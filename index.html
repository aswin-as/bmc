                    <p>Even though in the scene of higher education BMC is a newcomer, we have a long legacy of educational leadership to boast about. As the torch bearers of education in Kerala, starting with St. Kuriakose Elias Chavara (Chavarayachan), CMIs have been in the forefront of education for almost two centuries. We have over four decades of educational legacy in Palakkad through our reputed sister institutions. Bharathamatha College, a new venture at the request of our parent community is intended to create an ‘avant grade’ educational environment with our specified goals and objectives. As far as Bharathamatha College of Arts & Science is concerned, though it has been over five years since its inception, the beautiful facility is a witness to what we could achieve in this short time span. We had close to three hundred students complete their studies in last three batches including one of the top ten rank holders in English literature. We have more self-confident and highly skilled students with leadership capabilities coming out of this unique institution.

                    <p>As we enter into a new phase of growth; we want to articulate our dreams and emphasize our mission. We have an active and vibrant campus. Oriented towards the holistic development of students, the seminars, workshops, start-up labs, orientation classes, cultural and sports activities…we have plenty of programs within an academic year intended to enrich the learning environment. Keeping students involved and engaged, sometimes through a little bit of push and pull seems to be necessary for them to come out of their cocoons to bloom. New clubs and forums have breathed new life into the vibrancy of campus life.</p>

                    <p>The opening of Bharathamatha Centre for excellence (BCE) for promoting the professional training and skill development through certificate programs is a new stepping stone in the campus for the students to shine. During the lockdown through BCE the college created an opportunity for our students to gain certificates from reputed foreign universities through COURSERA.</p>

                <p>The untiring efforts of the CMI congregation in the field of education effect revolutionary changes in the society . St Kuriakose Elias Chavara , the founder of the CMI congregation , established the first catholic school of Kerala at Mannanam in 1846 . In the year 1846 , St. Chavara , in his capacity as the vicar General of the Syro - Malabar Church , ordered all the parishes to start schools adjacent to them . This historic order triggered the emergence of a galaxy of educational institutions all over the state . The Saint remains our inspiration forever . The main aim of the entire educational endeavor of the Congregation is to bring about a social transformation with an emphasis on option for the poor , coupled with the moral reconstruction in the society . Today , the CMIs run over 500 educational institutions . As a CMI Educational Institution we focus on the integral formation of the person for the fulfillment of his / her individual and social responsibilities .</p>
